# Academic Benchmarks Ruby Library

_Brought to you by your friends at [Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/)_ :heart:

## What is Academic Benchmarks?

[Academic Benchmarks](http://academicbenchmarks.com/) provides an API that allows a user with a subscription to download various [CBE standards](http://www.competencyworks.org/analysis/what-is-the-difference-between-standards-based-grading/).

## Why use this library?

* So you don't have to implement your own authentication
* To avoid dealing with raw endpoints
* Beating the pains of de-pagination
* For trees that actually work
* Re-using code is smart

## Get Started

This library mirrors the Academic Benchmarks API in order to make it easy to figure out what to do.  Once you get a `Handle` object, the rest is fairly intuitive.

### Install this gem

If you are developing an application, you should add `academic_benchmarks` to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'academic_benchmarks', '<current-version>'

Of course you can also just install the gem by itself:

    gem install academic_benchmarks

### Get some credentials

First you need some credentials (a "Partner ID" and a "Partner Key").  Either get some by paying Academic Benchmarks a pile of money, or by [signing up for a sandbox account](http://docs.academicbenchmarks.com/#?d=support&f=request_demo).

### Get a Handle

A `Handle` is how you interact with the API.  You can think of a handle as a configured connection that you can call methods on, and the rest "just works" &trade; â„¢

You can get your credentials into the library in either of two ways.  The way you choose probably depends on whether you're in production or test/development.  The environment variables are better practice for production, while the direct pass-in parameters are more convenient for development.

Pass-in credentials directly:

    ab_handle = AcademicBenchmarks::Api::Handle.new(partner_id: 'my-id', partner_key: 'my-key')

Or set environment variables:

    export ACADEMIC_BENCHMARKS_PARTNER_ID='my-id'
    export ACADEMIC_BENCHMARKS_PARTNER_KEY='my-key'

And instantiate:

    ab_handle = AcademicBenchmarks::Api::Handle.init_from_env

### Do Something

Now use the handle to get standards, either by searching or using convenience methods:

#### Search for standards

The parameters accepted by the search method mirror [the AB API](http://docs.academicbenchmarks.com/#?d=api&f=standards).  See those docs for an enumeration.

Search for some some text within standards:

    ab_handle.standards.search(query: "my search query")

Retrieve all standards from a certain authority (Indiana given in the example)

    ab_handle.standards.search(authority: "IN")

#### List available authorities

    ab_handle.standards.authorities

#### Retrieve all standards

NOTE: If you have a lot of standards in your subscription, _this will take a really long time_

    ab_handle.standards.all

#### Retrieve a specified guid

    ab_handle.standards.guid("<some-guid>">)

This can be restricted to certain fields.  See [the list of all available fields](http://docs.academicbenchmarks.com/#?d=api&f=standards):

    ab_handle.standards.guid("<some-guid>">, fields: %w[descr number version])

## Manual Testing

See TESTPLAN.md for a test plan that can be followed by a QA team to verify functionality of the library.

## Contributing

We would love some contributions!  There is detailed information in CONTRIBUTING.md, but the gist is:

1.  Match our style.  It doesn't have to be perfect but inconsistent styles in a codebase can make reading the code difficult
1.  Write a test.  Not everything is testable, but most things are.  If you can, write a test.  If you don't know how, send a PS and we'll try to work with you.
1.  Update the documentation.  If your feature should be in the README, then add it!  Also, if it makes sense, please add a manual verification step to TESTPLAN.md.
